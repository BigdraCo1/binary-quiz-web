# Binary Quiz 1.0
This is a website for practice about binary addition(subtraction, multiplication, division, bit operation coming soon) 
and answer in hexadecimal. I made this website for Lab 8 and Lab 9 in Digital System Fundamental(subject at Computer Engineering, KMITL).
Those Lab about fast binary calculator competition but in this subject learning about Hardware and FPGA.
I think this is so weird. <br><br>
