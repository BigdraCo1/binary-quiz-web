## Introduction
This is a website for quiz practicing about binary addition, subtraction, left shift, exclusive or 
and answer in hexadecimal. I made this website for Lab 8 and Lab 9 in Digital System Fundamental (subject at Computer Engineering, KMITL).
Those Lab about fast binary calculator competition but in this subject learning about Hardware and FPGA.
I think this is so weird. 

## How to use?
This website generates solution as random 2 binary numbers and you can answer a result in hexadecimal in text input and you can press
enter key or click submit button to submit your answer. If your answer are correct this website will generate next solution but 
your answer are incorrect this website will show red border at text input. You can click random button to generates new solution.
